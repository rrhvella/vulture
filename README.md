A little prototype for me to try out flecs, raylib and emscripten. And to learn a bit about ecs design.

To try out, you need [python3](https://www.python.org/) to run a test server.

With python3 installed, and the repository checked out, run the following commands in the project root.

```
cd ./bin/emscripten
python -m http.server 8081
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:8081 in your browser.

Use the arrow keys to move

z to shoot
